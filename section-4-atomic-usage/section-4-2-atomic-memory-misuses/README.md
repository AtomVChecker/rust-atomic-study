# GitHub commit information from real-world Rust projects supporting the study of atomic misuse issues

## Atomic concurrency bugs
We collect 15 atomic concurrency bugs caused by the incorrect use of weak memory orderings, all from Rust's safe code. See [Atomic concurrency bugs](incorrect use of weak orderings).

## Atomic performance issues
We collect 150 atomic performance issues caused by the incorrect use of strong memory orderings. Here, we highlight only a subset of those that have been addressed in the GitHub community. See [Atomic performance issues](incorrect use of strong orderings).
