# ISSRE'24 Code and Research Data Release

## section-4-atomic-usage
This section includes the use of atomic types(see [atomic-usage-count](section-4-atomic-usage/section-4-1-reason-for-usage/atomic-usage-count)), performance comparisons of atomic types with other concurrency primitives(see [performance-test](/section-4-atomic-usage/section-4-1-reason-for-usage/performance-test)), collection of memory ordering misuse problems(see [atomic-memory-misuses](section-4-atomic-usage/section-4-2-atomic-memory-misuses)), and performance evaluation of different memory orderings(see [ordering-performance-issues](section-4-atomic-usage/section-4-3-ordering-performance-issues)).


## section-5-detection
This section includes source code for detecting memory ordering misuses(see [AtomVChecker](https://github.com/AtomVChecker/rust-atomic-study/tree/main/section-5-detection/AtomVChecker)), and adds experimental results for atomic correlations(see [atomic correlations](https://github.com/AtomVChecker/rust-atomic-study/blob/main/section-5-detection/README.md)).
